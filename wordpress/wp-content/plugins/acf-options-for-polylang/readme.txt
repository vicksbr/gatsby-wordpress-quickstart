Add ACF options page support for Polylang.

== Description ==

You are using Advanced Custom Fields for creating option pages and you have Polylang installed for awsome multilingual site ?

Sadly, Polylang is not handling ACF's Option Pages. Which means values will be the same for all languages you have set.

We are here to save your life ! Once this plugin is activated, you will be able to set a different value for each language, and if none is set, the "All languages" value will be used as default one.

# How ?

This plugin will store a value for each language into database. Then Polylang's languages are used to get the values from the DB. <b>That means at activation, all existing data will not be anymore available, but still in database. You will retrieve it at plugin deactivation.</b>

Then to set and contribute your option page, simply use the Polylang's language admin flags ui.

# Features

- Almost simple fields (text, textarea, links, etc)
- Repeater fields (with simple fields)
