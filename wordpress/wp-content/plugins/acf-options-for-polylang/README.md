# BEA - ACF Options For Polylang

[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/beapi/acf-options-for-polylang/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/beapi/acf-options-for-polylang)

You are using Advanced Custom Fields for creating option pages and you have Polylang installed for awsome multilingual site ?

Sadly, Polylang is not handling ACF's Option Pages. Which means values will be the same for all languages you have set.

We are here to save your life ! Once this plugin is activated, you will be able to set a different value for each language, and if none is set, the "All languages" value will be used as default one.

# How ?

This plugin will store a value for each language into database. Then Polylang's languages are used to get the values from the DB. <b>That means at activation, all existing data will not be anymore available, but still in database. You will retrieve it ad plugin deactivation.</b>

Then to set and contribute your option page, simply use the Polylang's language admin flags ui.

# Requirements

- Require [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) 4.7+ / Tested up to 5.2
- Require PHP 5.6
- [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro) 5.6.0+

## For developers

## Using fields

Nothing change, we have made all the hooks for you, so no need to prefix your fields with a lang or something else.
Only use ACF's helpers to get and show the fields as you did before with [get_field()](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/get_field/) or the_field() : 

`get_field( 'footer_disclaimer', 'options' );`

## Default values (with "All languages")

The plugin is designed to get the Polylang "All languages" value if the current lang one is empty. But if you are not interested about this behaviour, you can programmatically deactivate it using the following filter by setting to false.

### For all ACF Options pages

```
<?php add_filter( 'bea.aofp.get_default', '__return_false' );
```

### For just one ACF Options page

```
<?php add_filter( 'bea.aofp.get_default', function( $show_default, $post_id ) {
	if ( 'my_custom_acf_option_post_id' === $post_id ) {
		// Custom condition for the wanted post id ACF Option page
		return false;
	}

	return $show_default;
}, 10, 2 );
```
